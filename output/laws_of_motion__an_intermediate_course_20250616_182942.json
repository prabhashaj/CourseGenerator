    "introduction": "Welcome to the 'Laws of Motion' course! This course is designed for learners with a foundational understanding of physics and aims to provide a deeper dive into Newton's Laws of Motion. We will explore the concepts of force, inertia, acceleration, and their applications in real-world scenarios.",
