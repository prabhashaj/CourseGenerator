    "introduction": "Welcome to Academic Influence Metrics! This intermediate-level course provides a comprehensive overview of the various metrics used to assess the impact and influence of academic research. We will explore traditional citation-based metrics, alternative metrics (altmetrics), and emerging approaches for evaluating research quality and impact. This course is designed for researchers, librarians, administrators, and anyone interested in understanding how academic influence is measured and evaluated.",
