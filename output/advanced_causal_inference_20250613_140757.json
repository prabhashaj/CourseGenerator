    "conclusion": "By the end of this course, students will be equipped with a strong understanding of causal inference methods and their applications in various fields. They will be able to critically evaluate causal claims, design causal studies, and apply appropriate techniques to estimate causal effects from observational and experimental data.",
    "courseTitle": "Advanced Causal Inference",
    "introduction": "This advanced course provides a comprehensive overview of causal inference methods, focusing on both theoretical foundations and practical applications. It is designed for students and researchers with a strong background in statistics and econometrics who are interested in learning how to estimate causal effects from observational and experimental data. The course covers a range of topics, including potential outcomes, causal graphs, identification strategies, and estimation techniques.",
